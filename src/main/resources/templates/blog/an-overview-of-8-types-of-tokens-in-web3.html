                <div id="content" class="rich-text w-richtext"><p>With so many tokens out there, it can be complicated
                    to know what distinguishes one from another. In this guide, we’ll walk through the various types of
                    tokens in the market today and what they’re for. Let’s dig in.</p>
                    <h2 id="blockchain-tokens">Blockchain Tokens</h2>
                    <p>Blockchain tokens refer to the native token of a blockchain—like Bitcoin’s BTC, Ethereum’s ETH,
                        and Stacks’ STX. Blockchains are the foundational layer of Web3 architecture, and these tokens
                        are a core function of that foundation.</p>
                    <p>The first blockchain token, Bitcoin, was created as “a purely <a
                            href="https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper" rel="noopener noreferrer">peer-to-peer version
                        of electronic cash</a>”, and while these tokens can be used as payment, they are also much more
                        than that. Blockchain tokens are integral to the running of the network itself: users pay
                        transaction fees in blockchain tokens to send transactions over the network. Miners/stakers earn
                        fees in blockchain tokens for their work to validate transactions and package them in blocks. In
                        other words, blockchain tokens are the incentive structure that drives rational behavior and
                        participation from the public.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>This is why blockchain tokens are sometimes called “gas tokens”—they are the fuel that powers the
                        network. Without them, there is no incentive for the network to process transactions. Most
                        blockchain tokens are inflationary; every new block of transactions introduces new tokens to the
                        network (hence the term “mining” of new blocks). These new mined tokens are an additional
                        incentive for the network to process transactions.</p>
                    <p>However, there is often a cap on how many tokens will be minted, and those rewards diminish over
                        time. For example, Bitcoin’s supply is capped at<a
                                href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/802775/worldwide-cryptocurrency-maximum-supply/"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer"> 21 million BTC</a>. Once the cap is reached, the network
                        depends on transaction fees to incentivize miners to continue to package new blocks.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 id="stablecoins">Stablecoins</h2>
                    <p>While blockchain tokens were originally designed to function as digital money, they’ve struggled
                        to gain mass adoption because of a fatal flaw—their prices are very volatile. Remember that the
                        supply of blockchain tokens is often capped; a capped supply means the price will change to meet
                        demand. That price volatility makes it hard to build a payment network around. Why would you pay
                        with an asset that could double in value tomorrow? And why would a merchan accept an asset that
                        could be worth half of its value in an hour? That’s why stablecoins were created.</p>
                    <p>Stablecoins are Web3 tokens that maintain a stable price and are usually pegged 1:1 to another
                        asset, such as a fiat currency like the US dollar. Examples of stablecoins include USDT, USDC,
                        and DAI. While the value of other tokens can fluctuate wildly, the value of stablecoins doesn’t
                        change (1 USDT is always worth $1), hence the name “stable.”&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Consumers and merchants can agree on the value of a good and pay the corresponding amount in a
                        stablecoin. It’s fair for both parties, and that makes stablecoins perfect for payments, which
                        has led to soaring adoption. After legacy tokens Bitcoin and Ethereum, the stablecoin USDT has
                        the largest marketcap of any cryptocurrency and between June 2020 and June 2022, the<a

                        demand for stablecoins underscores the need for natively digital money as the global economy
                        moves increasingly online. Interestingly, many governments worldwide see the value of
                        stablecoins too. Many are now interested in creating their own through <a

                    <h2 id="utility-tokens">Utility Tokens</h2>
                    <p>Utility tokens, or protocol tokens, are digital assets used to access specific services or
                        products within a Web3 ecosystem. Examples of utility tokens include Brave’s BAT, Arweave’s AR,
                        and Chainlink’s LINK.</p>
                    <p>Utility tokens became popular during the build-up to the<a
                            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/technology/what-is-an-initial-coin-offering.html"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"> 2017 ICO rush</a> because founders mainly sold them to raise
                        funds for new crypto projects, and people bought them as speculative assets—in reality, most of
                        those were security tokens, not utility tokens (more on that below), but it did kickstart their
                        entrance to market.</p>
                    <p>Utility tokens are how users access the <em>utility</em> of a particular app, whether to purchase
                        its services or as a mechanism to unlock reward incentives. For instance, Brave uses BAT tokens
                        to reward users for viewing ads and to pay creators for making content. Similarly, Arweave’s
                        users buy data storage with AR tokens.</p>
                    <p>In other words, utility tokens are the medium of exchange between users and the app, and between
                        different users on the app.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 id="governance-tokensnbsp">Governance Tokens&nbsp;</h2>
                    <p>Governance tokens enable decentralized governance, allowing for the creation of networks run by
                        the community rather than a centralized authority. These tokens give users voting rights to
                        decide how a Web3 network or app runs and functions—such as what features should be prioritized,
                        what protocol changes should be made, if any, and more.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, governance tokens are combined with utility tokens (so the same token offers both
                        functionality and voting rights), and in some apps and protocols, token holders can also
                        delegate their voting rights to other users.</p>
                    <p>To illustrate the power of governance tokens, let’s take a look at Compound’s COMP and Aave’s
                        AAVE tokens. Last month, AAVE holders voted on a<a
                                href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/152/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> proposal
                            to add USDT to its Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool</a>. The proposal aimed to increase stablecoin
                        diversity in the AAVE ecosystem, and the vote succeeded with a “Yae” vote from 88% of
                        participants. Similarly, Compound users had a chance to vote on a<a
                                href="https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/154" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                            proposal to resume minting cUSDC</a> after the price destablized in the wake of the Silicon
                        Valley Bank collapse. These types of decisions and more are determined by governance token
                        holders.</p>
                    <h2 id="non-fungible-tokens-nfts">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</h2>
                    <p>An NFT is a one-of-a-kind digital asset that can be verified as the original. At the core of the
                        NFT concept lies the idea of non-fungibility. Most other tokens are fungible, meaning that they
                        are interchangeable (like fiat—a $1 bill can be swapped with any other $1 bill and the value is
                        the same). In contrast, NFTs are unique: each asset is a 1 of 1 and can be verified
                        on-chain.</p>
                    <p>The uniqueness of each NFT makes it possible to create digital scarcity and enables all kinds of
                        use cases, ranging from art collections like <a href="https://www.megapont.com/"
                                                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Megapont</a> to
                        identity solutions like <a href="https://btc.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">BNS</a>
                        (your_name.btc). These assets are liquid and can be traded just like physical goods or a
                        currency, but you are able to verify their authenticity.</p>
                    <p>NFTs are redefining the idea of ownership and authenticity in the digital age. This novel
                        approach to digital ownership is already accelerating and reaching mainstream adoption. The
                        number of wallets holding NFTs on Ethereum<a href="https://dune.com/thomas_m/NFT-stats"
                                                                     rel="noopener noreferrer"> soared more than
                            9,000%</a> between January 2019 and January 2023.</p>
                    <h2 id="security-tokensnbsp">Security Tokens&nbsp;</h2>
                    <p>Security tokens represent financial securities like stocks, bonds, and real estate. Unlike
                        utility tokens, which are used to access services on a platform, security tokens offer investors
                        ownership rights in a company. One of the clear differentiators between security tokens and the
                        others listed here is that security tokens are required to comply with securities regulations,
                        which impact their issuance and ability to trade.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned above, many ICOs (initial token offerings) from the 2017 bull run sold “utility
                        tokens” to investors, but in fact were unregistered securities and closer to a security token
                        all along (something the SEC has since gone and <a
                                href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/07/now-more-than-ever-sec-is-scrutinizing-unregistered-token-offerings/"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">fined many companies</a> for). Today, projects building in the
                        security token space include <a href="https://www.tzero.com/"
                                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">tZERO</a>,<a

                                href="https://polymath.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Polymath</a>.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Security tokens can theoretically improve the efficiency and liquidity of traditional securities
                        markets. By digitizing securities, we can reduce the need for intermediaries, streamline the
                        trading process, and lower the barriers to investment opportunities by offering fractional
                        ownership and lower issuing costs.</p>
                    <h2 id="privacy-coins">Privacy Coins</h2>
                    <p>Privacy or anonymous coins are digital assets that enable users to hide their transactions.
                        Blockchains by default make all transactions open to the public—anyone can see the sender,
                        recipient, amount sent, and other metadata of a cryptocurrency transaction. This creates a need
                        for solutions that can mask that data and provide better privacy and anonymity to
                        users.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>That’s where privacy coins come in. These tokens protect user identity and behavior by making it
                        much more difficult, or even impossible, to know the originating wallet for a transaction, how
                        much was sent, and who the recipient is. To do this, privacy tokens use a range of tactics, from
                        Ring Signatures or stealth addresses, to batching transacstions and zero-knowledge proofs.
                        Examples of privacy coins include<a href="https://www.getmonero.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                            Monero</a> and<a href="https://z.cash/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Zcash</a>.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The privacy created by these tokens aids financial freedom by preventing third parties from
                        monitoring or tracking users’ transactions. Financial privacy also makes users less vulnerable
                        to extortion or blackmail.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 id="soulbound-tokens">Soulbound Tokens</h2>
                    <p>Soulbound tokens (SBTs) are non-transferrable digital assets tied to the owner’s identity. These
                        unique tokens are similar to NFTs with the important distinction that they cannot be traded.
                        Once an SBT is added to a particular address, it is tied to that address forever. These tokens
                        can be used as digital proof of an achievement or as part of a reputation system.</p>
                    <p>Compared to other tokens listed in this article, SBTs are at a very early stage, and there aren’t
                        many examples live in the market today. <a
